       <p class = "info">   Hi, my name is Tony Gomez and i'm Peruvian and Ecuadorian,
          but i'm born in America. I enjoy coding, studing langauages, and playing video games.
          I enjoy coding because of the complexity of computer science; which is the reason for languages
          and video games. My family are very calm and friendly, which caused me to produce a friendly personality
          with others. I've been through many things with my family, but we still managed to help others and support ourselves.
          I would want to become a web-developer and make designs for specific websites, but I would also explore different countrie
          to learn about their culture.</p>
